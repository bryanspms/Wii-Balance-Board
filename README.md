## Troubleshooting
1. Unable to connect the Wii Balance Board via Bluetooth in Windows 11  
   - Disable Bluetooth on your laptop or PC.  Note that you may need to disable the existing bluetooth adapter in Device Manager.
   - Install a [CSR4.0 Mini USB Bluetooth Adapter Wireless Dongle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KC39CCL?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title).  Note that you may need to update the drivers for the new device.
   - Connect the Balance Board to the new Bluetooth adapter per API instructions.
2. Still unable to connect to the Wii Balance Board via Bluetooth in Windows 11 after trying everything else.
   - Despite trying everything else, the Balance Board still will not connect.  If we cannot get around a problem, then we just have to plow through it.  Here is how to bridge the Wii Balance Board: [Guide](Wii-Balance-Board-Bridge.md)
